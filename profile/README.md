Collaborate on data. Not on trust.

Privacy-first data collaboration platform. Data stays put, cryptography enforces it — not just policy.

## What We Build

- **Confidential computing** — model training and inference on encrypted data within the client's own cloud using hardware enclaves and envelope encryption
- **Explainable AI** — interpretable ML pipelines with feature attribution (WoE/IV), stability monitoring (PSI/KS), and automated drift detection — e.g. fraud detection, credit risk scoring
- **Privacy-preserving data enrichment** — identity-resolved signals from alternate data providers via hash-based matching, without exposing PII on either side — e.g. risk intelligence, growth analytics
- **Data collaboration** — secure exchange between data providers and consumers for audience intelligence, targeting, and analytics

## Open Source

- [dataprism](https://pypi.org/project/dataprism/) — exploratory data analysis library with interactive visualizations, data quality scoring, and stability monitoring
